# acme-dns-pdns

This is the PowerDNS-compatible server part of [acme-dns-client](https://github.com/stuvusIT/acme-dns-client).
It expects to be run behind a reverse proxy which verifies the certificates and sets the client certificate DN into a header.

The ACL system works by allowing a DN (key of the dict) to request ceritificates for a list of names (the value) or a list consisting of the single element `*` which allows fetching certificates for all names.

After the record was changed, the secondaries are notified and the server waits for replication.

## Requirements

Debian 11
